//The Pursuit of Money
//This program calculates the amount of time by percent that an individual will spend in a year
//to acquire their desired annual income given their current income and hours worked per week.
//The program then compares this percentage to the percent difference between the user's
//desired salary and current salary.  Finally the program classifies the user based upon a tiered percent-based
//ranking system that utilizes survey data on how people perceive individuals who work a certain percentage of the year.

/*approx hours per year: 8765.81*/
