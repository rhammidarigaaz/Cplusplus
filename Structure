//This program creates a structure called Points that consists of two integer coordinates a and b.
//The program then prompts the user to input two sets of integer coordinates into Points.
//Function Sum then accepts the two sets into Points and returns the sum of the two sets in Points
//The program finally prints the sum of the two sets in Points
